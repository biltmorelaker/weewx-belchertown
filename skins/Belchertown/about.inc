<p>This website is automatically updated in near real time (about every 2.5 seconds) with weather observations from a <a href="https://www.davisinstruments.com/solution/vantage-vue/" target="_blank">Davis Vantage Vue</a> personal weather station located in my backyard in Biltmore Lake, NC. Weather data, sent wirelessly to a Davis weather console in my home, is output and processed by the weeWX weather software running on a $10 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi Zero W</a> single board computer which archives it and feeds the website. The weather station provides the following readings:</p>

<ul> 
     <li>Temperature
     <li>Humidity 
     <li>Wind speed  
     <li>Wind direction  
     <li>Rainfall  
     <li>Barometric Pressure
</ul>

<p>The rest of the observations indicated on this website are done via software calculations and quality control checks to make sure the data is valid.</p>

All weather observations are also posted to:
