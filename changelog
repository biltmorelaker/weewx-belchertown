0.8.1 December 7, 2018
* Fixes an edge case scenario where skin fails to generate due to N/A as a wind observation value.
* Fixes some false positive errors with belchertown_root_url or station_url being reported it's not set. 
* On the front page, change the wording to Chart instead of Graphs above the chart region. Afterall, these are charts and not graphs. I should probably update everything to be "chart". 

0.8 December 2, 2018
* A lot of metric conversion fixes. A lot. 
* More metric conversions fixes.
* Now uses new option belchertown_root_url and falls back to station_url for the URL of your weather station. The CSS and JavaScript files are dependant on this setting. 
    * This new setting means you can run your station on a different URL than station_url. The station_url can be used to show your station on the weewx.com map. So the belchertown_root_url was added in case you did not want that, or if you want to run test sites, offline sites, or have Belchertown on a different folder or site all together than station_url.
* You can now select your own graph order and also can pick from 8 graphs to show in 6 positions. Details on the user guide on GitHub
* 4 Custom rows now available on index page for you to customize content. Check the readme on GitHub for more info on how to use these areas.
* Better fallback method if the earthquake data has no recent earthquakes.
* Added option to change DarkSky language. Use darksky_lang in configs.
* Add rainfall total line graph to year graphs.
* Show rainRate on day, week, month charts instead of bucket tips. This makes for a much more interesting graph. 
* Remove rounding on the rainRate chart
* Added a windy.png icon, which is a clone of wind.png. Sometimes DarkSky wants wind.png and other times windy.png
* Added a Raspberry Pi kiosk page. 
    * This is handy if you want a 2nd console display using a [Raspberry Pi and a 3.5" TFT screen like this one](https://amzn.to/2z37wlV). An example of it in use [can be seen here](https://obrienlabs.net/redirecting-weather-station-data-from-observerip/#website).
    * This page also does not have the MQTT timeout, so the Kiosk console display will update forever.
* Some other bug fixes and code optimization.


0.7 September 8, 2018
* Separate Highcharts from the main skin into its own skin. In testing this has shown to speed up skin generation times. **Strongly advise you to uninstall Belchertown skin, and install 0.7 as a new skin**. Also, **be sure to have a backup of your skin customizations**
* The highcharts extension gets its options from the Belchertown main skin. Keep your highcharts options under Belchertown's main Extras section. 
* Moved highcharts timespans to our own intervals and not using the timespan intervals. 
* Better handling of default about and records page. Now includes an `about.inc.example` and `records.inc.example` to show what you can do. If `about.inc` or `records.inc` is missing, then the skin will show some default information rather than throwing an error.
* Moved the forecast and earthquake functions into the main `getData()` class.
* Adjusted `.wind.` on the records page to `.windGust.` which should fix the errors that have been reported.
* Moved the moment.js utcOffset back to minutes instead of hours.
* If no earthquake data is available in your region, we now display that information as "No recent earthquake data available!". If this affects you, you can expand your `earthquake_maxradiuskm`. 
* Cleaned up a lot of old code from the Highcharts extension included in this skin. 


0.6 August 30, 2018
* Skip NULL rain values in highcharts generator.
* Updated rainRate value on the front page and records page. 
* Fix all time record for barometer. It was showing dewpoint. Oops!
* Fixed a highcharts UTC graph error. Should prefer timezone offset now.
* Updated highcharts rain rounding to 2 decimals.
* Updated highcharts wind direction to have a hover and display the wind direction.
* Consolidated the getSocialShare and getNOAAdata into getAllTime, and renamed getAllTime to getData. Larger plan is to consolidate as much as possible to be able to minimize the number of SLE loops. This may or may not have a better performance, but I'll try and consolidate where it makes sense in an attempt at better performance.
* Added a version printout in syslog for easier troubleshooting.
* Removed about.inc and reports.inc from the installer because the installer was overwriting them. Please read the Readme on how to create these files. 


0.5 August 27, 2018
* Fixed NOAA report conflict.
* Updated highcharts to reflect the station's UTC timezone offset.
* Front page MQTT live updates now optimized for metric and metricwx units.
* Now uses UTC offset for moment.js and "Data Received" timestamp when using MQTT.
* Fixed full moon icon.


0.4 August 23, 2018
* Better usage of getting the right label from the skin dict. This fixes the wrong windSpeed label in the DarkSky forecast row. Thanks Gary!
* Changes the way of determining the DarkSky visibility unit label values. Gets the unit from the API output, then sets the label. Fixes the wrong label when using "auto" for DarkSky units.
* Fixed a barometer rounding bug in the highcharts generator.


0.3 August 22, 2018
* Fixed a bug with the DarkSky URL.
* Removed an extra pre-requisites check.  
* Updated the visibility unit check. DarkSky API does not return this in their output, so using a mixture of skin and weewx config settings, hopefully we can determine the unit you want. 
* Fixed another static unit on the records page.


0.2 August 22, 2018
* Added units to the darksky api url with "auto" units as the default. Auto units automatically selects units based on your geographic location.
* Added a windy icon by remixing a couple images together.
* Updated records page units which had some hard coded units by mistake
* Fixed lowest windchill on the records page
* Fixed a formatting error with the sunrise and sunset auto-refesh


0.1 August 21, 2018
* Initial implementation
